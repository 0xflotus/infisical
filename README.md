- **Multiple Environments** per project (e.g. development, staging, production, etc.)
- **Personal/Shared** scoping for environment variables.
- **1-Click Deploy** to Digital Ocean (other providers coming soon).
- **Integrations** with CI/CD and production infrastructure (coming soon).
- **Automatic Secret Rotation** (coming soon).
