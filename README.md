## What's cool about this?

Infisical is the first open-source end-to-end encrypted secret manager that takes less than 10 minutes to setup.

Yes. There are other secret managers out there. Some of them are incredibly complicated - they were built for security teams, not developers. The other ones are not end-to-end encrypted, and because of that they can read your secrets. If you care about efficiency and security at the same time - Infisical is right for you.

On top of that, Infisical is one of the few open source solutions. Need any integrations or want a new feature? You can [create an issue for us](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/issues) or contribute directly! This is the power of open-source. :)

## Status

- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [infisical.com](https://infisical.com) but go easy on us, there are kinks and we're just getting started.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready.

## Integrations

We're currently setting the foundation and building integrations so secrets can be synced everywhere. Any help is welcome! :)

- [x] Docker
- [x] Docker Compose
- [x] Heroku
- [ ] Vercel
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] AWS
- [ ] GCP
- [ ] Azure
- [ ] Digital Ocean
- [ ] GitLab
- [ ] CircleCI

We're currently in Public Alpha.

## Open-source vs. paid

This repo is entirely MIT licensed, with the exception of the `ee` directory which will contain premium enterprise features requring a Infisical license in the future. We're currently focused on developing non-enterprise offerings first that should suit most use-cases.

## Security

Looking to report a security vulnerability? Please don't post about it in GitHub issue. Instead, refer to our [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) file.
