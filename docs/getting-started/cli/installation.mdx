## Usage

Once you have the CLI installed in your system, follow the guide to login and sync your first project.

#### Login

Login to the CLI by running the following command in your terminal

```
infisical login
```

<Info>
  To authenticate without logging in manually, read about [Infisical
  Token](/infisicalToken)
</Info>
#### Link secrets to your project After logging in, `CD` into the root of your local
project. Then run the following command in the terminal to link your Infisical project
to your local project.

```
infisical init
```

#### Inject

To inject the secrets from the Infisical project you have selected in step 2 into your application process, run the following command.

```
infisical run -- <your application start command>
```

Example:

```
infisical run -- npm run dev
```

By default, Infisical injects secrets from your development environment. To modify from which environment your secrets are pulled from, use the --stage flag

Example:

```
infisical run --stage=prod -- npm run dev
```

You're now automatically pulling and injecting secrets as environment variables into your application!
