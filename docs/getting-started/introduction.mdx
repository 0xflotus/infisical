Infisical is an [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) secret manager that enables teams to easily manage and sync their environment variables.

It stops [secret sprawl](https://www.gitguardian.com/glossary/secret-sprawl-definition) by providing a single source-of-truth for environment variables. It offers a dashboard for teams to manage environment variables and a platform-agnostic CLI to inject them into apps and infrastructure.

Some problems we solve:

- Leaking .env files to version control.
- Debugging missing environment variables.
- Sending environment variables over email.

Infisical uses [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) to ensure that only designated team members can read their environment variables; unless intended for specific integrations, environment variables are always encrypted before being sent to the server.
